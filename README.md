Event Booking System..

A simple event booking system built with Laravel. Users can log in, book events, and view their booking history.
Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

    PHP 8.2

    Composer (for PHP dependency management)

    XAMPP (includes Apache, MySQL, and phpMyAdmin)

    Git (for cloning the repository)

Installation Steps
1. Install XAMPP

If you havenâ€™t already installed XAMPP, download and install it from XAMPPâ€™s official website. XAMPP comes with Apache, MySQL, PHP, and phpMyAdmin, which are necessary for running the Laravel application.
2. Start XAMPP Services

    Open the XAMPP Control Panel.

    Start Apache and MySQL services by clicking on the Start buttons next to them.

3. Clone the Repository

Clone the project repository from GitHub:

git clone https://github.com/Mrinmoydeb/event_booking.git

4. Move the Project to XAMPP's htdocs

Move your event_booking project folder into the htdocs directory of XAMPP. By default, this is located at:

C:\xampp\htdocs\

So, the project should be located at:

C:\xampp\htdocs\event_booking

5. Set Up the Database

    Open phpMyAdmin by going to http://localhost/phpmyadmin.


6. Configure Environment Variables

Edit the .env file located in the root of your project (C:\xampp\htdocs\event_booking\.env). Update the database configuration to match your XAMPP setup:

DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=event_booking 
DB_USERNAME=root         
DB_PASSWORD=            

7. Install PHP Dependencies

Open a terminal and navigate to your project directory:

cd C:\xampp\htdocs\event_booking

Then run the following command to install the PHP dependencies:

composer install

8. Generate Application Key

Run the following command to generate a new application key:

php artisan key:generate

9. Run Database Migrations

Run the database migrations to create the necessary tables in your MySQL database:

php artisan migrate

You can also populate the database with sample data:

php artisan db:seed

10. Start the Application

Run the Laravel development server by using the following command:

php artisan serve

By default, this will start the application at:

http://localhost:8000

However, since we are using XAMPP, it's better to access the application via Apache. You can now open your browser and visit:

http://localhost/event_booking/public
